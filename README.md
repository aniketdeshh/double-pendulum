## The Double Pendulum
This is a calculation of the Langrange's equations and animation of the _double pendulum_, a famous classical mechanics system known for its chaotic nature.

I use sympy to solve for the equations of motion, numpy to numerically solve the differential equations, and matplotlib to animate the pendulum. The repository include the main python file and the notebook which includes a plot of both angles. The animation will appear soon after running the python file, depending on the hardware you are using.
